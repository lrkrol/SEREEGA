v1.1.0
- Added electrodes argument to plot_source_projection
- Added lf_prune_nyheadfile to reduce NY Head lead field filesize
- Changed generate_scalpdata behaviour when one component has multiple sources. The projections from each source are now summed together. Previous behaviour, which used only one randomly chosen souce per epoch, can be reinstated with the argument legacy_rndmultsrc.

v1.0.19-beta
- Lead fields now continue with empty labels (i.e. all channels) if montage not found
- Fixed bug in utl_shift_latency arguments
- Added utl_apply_dvslopeshift, and replaced all calls to predecessor utl_apply_dvslope with it
- Added utl_multigradient for updated default projection colormap
- Added utl_epoch2continuous after GitHub issue #4
- Fixed GitHub issue #10 where latencies were off by 1 sample in erp_generate_signal and ersp_generate_signal
- Added shading argument to plot_source_projection
- Fixed GitHub issue #11 where utl_multigradient was not called in plot_source_projection and plot_component_projection

v1.0.11-beta
- Fixed GitHub issue #3 in lf_get_projection
- Fixed issue in pop_sereega_plot_headmodel
- Improved feedback for some pop_ functions
- Made the menu available in EEGLAB even when no dataset is loaded
- Added utl_isvalidcomponent
- Fixed GUI issue in plot_source_location

v1.0.5-beta
- Updated GUI with previous version's changes

v1.0.4-beta
- Added peakLatencyShift parameter to ERP class
- Added frequencyShift parameter to ERSP class
- Updated ERSP classes in utl_get_component_fromtemplate using frequencyShift
- Fixed utl_apply_dvslope to never apply deviations exceeding indicated deviation value

v1.0.0-beta
- The version described in and used for the bioRxiv preprint 326066
